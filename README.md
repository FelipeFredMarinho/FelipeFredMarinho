## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Felipe Marinho

I'm a **Software Developer** with a background in **Control and Automation Engineering**, focused on **backend development**, system integration, and building reliable and efficient software.

I have professional experience working with **C, C#, .NET Core, WPF, and MySQL**, developing **RESTful APIs**, desktop applications, and automation tools. I enjoy working close to the system level, caring about **performance, code quality, and maintainability**.

Currently, I'm expanding my skills in **Golang** and **Java**, studying modern backend architectures, distributed systems, and software engineering best practices. I also have a strong interest in **software security**, **low-level programming**, and technologies used in **critical systems**.
